# Mantras: An Extensible AI Agent Framework

Mantras provides a TypeScript-based framework for building AI agents designed to operate within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The core philosophy is to enable agents to learn, manage, and apply a diverse set of skills or tools (referred to as "Items" or "Tools", with `IMantra` as a foundational interface). This framework emphasizes modularity, allowing for clear separation between agent logic and the tools they utilize. Agents can be dynamically configured and managed, leveraging IDE-specific context and adhering to predefined rules to perform complex, context-aware, and rule-guided tasks.

## 🔖 Features

- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between agent logic and the tools (Mantras) they utilize, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Configuration & Management**: Agents and their Mantras can be configured (e.g., via YAML) and managed dynamically at runtime by the `AgentManager`.
- 💡 **IDE Context Awareness**: Agents can leverage rich contextual information from the IDE (`IDEContext`) to perform more intelligent and relevant actions.
- 📜 **Rule-Guided Execution**: Operations can be guided by a flexible set of rules (`IRule`) ensuring consistent behavior and adherence to specific constraints.
- 🛠️ **Extensible Toolset (Mantras)**: Easily define and integrate new skills or tools (`IMantra`) for agents to learn and apply.
- 🚀 **TypeScript-Powered**: Built with TypeScript, offering strong typing and a modern development experience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get your Mantras environment up and running in a few simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already)**:
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd mantras
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This compiles the TypeScript code from `src/` to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.

4.  **Run the Demo**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This executes the compiled `dist/index.js` file, which demonstrates core functionalities like registering an Item/Tool, an Agent learning it, and executing it with sample `IDEContext` and `IRule` objects.

    Alternatively, to run directly with `ts-node` during development (for faster iteration without manual recompilation):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🤔 What is Mantras?

Mantras is a TypeScript-based open-source framework designed for building sophisticated AI agents that operate seamlessly within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The core idea is to empower agents with a diverse set of skills or tools—referred to as "Mantras" (or "Items"/"Tools", with `IMantra` as the foundational interface).

The framework emphasizes:

*   **Modularity**: Keeping agent logic separate from the tools they use.
*   **Dynamic Management**: Agents can be configured and managed on the fly.
*   **Contextual Intelligence**: Agents leverage IDE-specific information to make smart decisions.
*   **Rule-Based Operations**: Agents follow predefined rules for consistent and predictable actions.

This approach allows for the creation of powerful, context-aware, and rule-guided AI assistants that can perform complex tasks directly within your development workflow.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

An overview of the Mantras project directory:

```

The `AgentManager` is a key component responsible for loading agent configurations (e.g., from YAML files), instantiating agents, and making them available for interaction. This allows for a flexible system where agents and their capabilities can be defined and extended without modifying the core framework.

## Core Concepts

- **Item/Tool (`IMantra`)**: The fundamental building block representing a specific skill, capability, or tool that an Agent can learn and execute. The base interface `IMantra` is defined in `src/tools/interfaces/mantra.interface.ts`.
  - `id`: Unique identifier.
  - `name`: Human-readable name.
  - `description`: Description of the Item/Tool's purpose.
  - `execute(ideContext?: IDEContext, rules?: IRule[], params?: any)`: Method to perform the Item/Tool's function, potentially using IDE context, rules, and custom parameters.
  - `metadata` (optional): Additional information like version, tags (e.g., 'tool', 'formatter').

- **ItemConfig (`ItemConfig`)**: Defines the configuration for an Item/Tool, such as its ID, name, description, and potentially an execution path or other metadata. Defined in `src/tools/interfaces/item-config.interface.ts`.

- **Agent (`IAgent`)**: Represents an AI entity within the IDE, capable of learning and executing Items/Tools. Defined in `src/agents/interfaces/agent.interface.ts`.
  - `id`: Unique identifier.
  - `name`: Human-readable name.
  - `status`: Current status of the agent (e.g., 'active', 'idle').
  - `capabilities`: A list of capabilities or roles the agent can fulfill.
  - `learnedItems`: List of Items/Tools the Agent has learned (instances of `IMantra`).
  - `learnItem(item: IMantra)`: Method for the Agent to acquire a new Item/Tool.
  - `forgetItem(itemId: string)`: Method for the Agent to discard an Item/Tool.
  - `executeRegisteredItem(itemId: string, ideContext?: IDEContext, rules?: IRule[], params?: any)`: Method for the Agent to execute a learned Item/Tool. It can also access and execute items from the global `Registry`.

- **AgentConfig (`AgentConfig`)**: Specifies the configuration for an Agent, including its ID, name, status, capabilities, and a list of `ItemConfig` objects defining the tools it should be equipped with. Defined in `src/agents/interfaces/agent-config.interface.ts`.

- **AgentManager**: A core service responsible for discovering, loading, and managing Agents based on their configurations (e.g., from YAML files). It instantiates `IAgent` objects and makes them available for use. Implemented in `src/agents/core/agent-manager.ts`.

- **Registry**: A central repository for all available Items/Tools. Agents can query the registry to discover and potentially learn new Items/Tools. Defined in `src/core/registry.ts`.

- **IDEContext (`IDEContext`)**: An interface representing contextual information from the IDE, such as open files, selected text, cursor position, project details, etc. Defined in `src/interfaces/ide.interface.ts`.

- **Rule (`IRule`)**: An interface for defining specific rules, guidelines, or constraints that an Agent or Item/Tool should adhere to during execution. Defined in `src/interfaces/ide.interface.ts`.
